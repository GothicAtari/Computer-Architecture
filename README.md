# Computer Architecture
 CPU Instructions coded in VHDL

## Description

### - The attached files are here to provide examples of VHDL programs that emulate the instructions of a simple CPU's components, such as the ALU, register, and multiplexer.
### - Screenshots are provided within each assignments folder to show successful results through signals simulations.
